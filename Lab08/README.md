#### Problem A README.md

# Block Tower Problem

## Description
Solution to the block tower optimization problem.

## Approach
- Mathematical solution based on tower values
- Time complexity: O(n) per test case

## Compilation
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o block_tower
```



# Binary Tree ADT

## Operations
1. Insert
2. Preorder
3. Inorder
4. Postorder
5. Search
6. Exit

## Compilation
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o binary_tree
```
